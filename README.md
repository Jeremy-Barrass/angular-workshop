## Exercises

* Test drive refactoring the CounterCtrl using a Factory/Service. How does this
  clean the controller up?
* Recreate the ExampleService test-first so that it gets the date from the
  [TimeAPI](http://www.timeapi.org/utc/now). You should use the $http module and
$httpBackend for mocking out calls to the API
